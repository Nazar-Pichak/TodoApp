# TodoApp

By following [tutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/django-tutorial/) about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) was created the project [TodoApp](http://todoapp-nazar2022.pythonanywhere.com/).
Not bad idea for good understanding and practicing with this framework.

The hardest was deploy and run this on the web server and sync it with [SMTP server](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/SMTP-Simple-Mail-Transfer-Protocol) to implement password recovery functionality via transactional emails and API service.

# How it works

# Web Services

- [Pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) as a hosting service.
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) as a smtp server with simple API integration for the most popular programming languges.
