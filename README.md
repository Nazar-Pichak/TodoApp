# TodoApp

By following [tutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/django-tutorial/) about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) was created the project [TodoApp](http://todoapp-nazar2022.pythonanywhere.com/).
Not bad idea for good understanding and practicing with this framework.

The hardest was deploy and run this on the web server and sync it with SMTP server to implement password recovery functionality.
